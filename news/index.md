# Changelog

## blockmodels 1.2.1

- Beginning adding handling of `NA` values in the data. Only scalar
  (with or without covariates) bernoulli, poisson and gaussian emission
  distribution models are supported for now. The `NA` values are ignored
  in the likelihood calculations, and the corresponding entries in the
  data are not used to update the parameters of the model.
- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
